| noun | 1.  	New characters in FFXIV are designated by a sprout icon next to their name, and the characters/players are often referred to as "sprouts." This icon can be toggled off if desired, for instance if you created another character but are already familiar with the game. The sprout icon signals to others that a player is relatively new to the game, which may sound worrying, but it almost universally results in people being friendlier and more accommodating. Often, if there is a sprout in the party, people will pause to explain important mechanics before a fight, or they'll know that they should check to make sure the sprout is finished viewing the cutscene before starting the fight. Mechanically, the sprout icon means someone is eligible to be invited to the Novice Network and is considered a new player for the purposes of certain aspects of the in-game Mentor system.	|
