---
|||
|---|---|
| noun | 1.  	Unsolicited, excessive, often repetitive messages or actions, including in-game job actions, that negatively affect or disrupt the experience of another player. Repeatedly, deliberately performing these actions at/around another player can be considered harassment, and if you are reported for it, a GM may take action against your account, depending on the circumstances. |
| verb | 2. Repeatedly sending the same input in quick succession, usually so that the desired action is executed as soon as possible, e.g. "spamming" an action while you're stunned so that it activates as soon as the stun wears off. |
| noun | 3. May also refer to repetitive advertisements in chat, such as repeatedly shouting the same recruitment message for a Free Company, or more egregiously, bots advertising RMT services.	|
