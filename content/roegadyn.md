| noun | 1.  	A larger playable race characterized by their imposing stature and musculature, and... unique naming conventions. It's unclear whether male Roegadyn have a cult following among players who appreciate their endearingly goofy mannerisms, or if playing a male Roegadyn is, in itself, the cult.	|
