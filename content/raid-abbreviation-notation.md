title: Raid Abbreviation Notation
---

| --- | --- |
| noun | 1.  	8-man raids are abbreviated according to the following notation: 

A letter representing the raid series, followed by a floor/encounter number from the series, followed by 'S' or 'N' to specify Savage or Normal difficulty. 

In the first raid series, Coil, the encounters in each of the raid tiers were named "Turn 1, Turn 2, "  and so on, so they are abbreviated as T1-T13. 

The official numbering started over with 1 for each tier, as in "The Second Coil of Bahamut, Turn 1," but the western community simply continued to count upward from where the previous tier left off. 

That trend caught on, which is how we got the convention widely used today.	|
