---
| noun | 1.  	1) May refer to various "Meteor" spells cast by certain bosses, which must usually be avoided by hiding behind something to break line of sight from the origin point. Being hit by one is almost always a guaranteed death, with possible exceptions for tank "invulnerability" skills. 2) A mechanic that requires the party to "defeat" several objects around the arena before the meteors they are calling touch the ground. 3) A mechanic that requires players to be standing in glowing circles around the arena to "catch" the slowly descending meteors above them.	|
