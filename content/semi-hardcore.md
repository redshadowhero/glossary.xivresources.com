title: Semi-hardcore
---
| noun | 1.  	At a basic level, "semi-hardcore" describes a level of dedication between midcore and hardcore. Beyond that, definitions vary wildly. The most obvious difference is time investment. As one example, a semi-hardcore raid group may want to take a few days off work for the release of a new raid tier to try to clear during the first week, but may not want to raid 16 hours a day, or may only do those hours for the first two days and then scale back. As another example, another type of semi-hardcore group may want to clear content quickly, advertising itself as "hardcore gameplay with midcore hours." This group wants fast progression, but may want to raid with much more moderate hours, which makes their niche somewhat unique, because making fast, efficient progress puts more emphasis on specific skills: being generally skilled, highly consistent with mechanics and performance, highly adaptive, and perhaps above all else, being a fast learner.	|
