| noun | 1.  	A mechanic that places a debuff on players, which will do Very Bad Things (often lethal damage) to the player if they are performing any action when the debuff expires, including using skills, casting, moving, auto attacking, and rotating their character. To avoid taking damage, players must cease all movement and actions when the debuff is about to expire, including sheathing their weapons or deselecting the enemy to prevent themselves from auto attacking.	|
