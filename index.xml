A linkshell is an established, invite-only chat channel, similar to how guild chat works in many games, but a linkshell is only the chat. Players can join up to eight regular linkshells. These are limited to players native to your own home server, and have a maximum capacity of 128 members each. Players may also join up to eight cross-world linkshells. These are only limited by your data center, which contains multiple servers, but each cross-world linkshell has a reduced maximum capacity of 64 members.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Combat Tracker</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/advanced-combat-tracker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/advanced-combat-tracker/</guid><description>| noun | 1. A third-party tool that parses combat data and presents it in a more meaningful, organized fashion, capable of displaying things like damage dealt, healing done, damage taken, frequency of critical and/or direct hits, etc. Colloquially referred to as a &amp;ldquo;parser&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;DPS meter.&amp;rdquo; More accurately, ACT is a program used for a variety of games and purposes, and the FFXIV Plugin for ACT is the parser. Using it is technically against the Terms of Service, but there is an unofficial understanding that it is an invaluable learning tool, and much of the information we have about how to play jobs efficiently would have been virtually impossible to figure out without the data that ACT is able to provide.</description></item><item><title>Alexander 1 Savage</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/alexander-1-savage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/alexander-1-savage/</guid><description>| noun | 1. &amp;ldquo;Alexander: Gordias - The Fist of the Father (Savage),&amp;rdquo;

The level 50 Coils of Bahamut raid series.
The encounters in each of the raid tiers were named &amp;ldquo;Turn 1, Turn 2, &amp;quot; etc., so they are abbreviated as T1-T13.
The first tier was The Binding Coil of Bahamut (BCoB). The second tier was The Second Coil of Bahamut (SCoB), and the final tier was The Final Coil of Bahamut (FCoB).
Note: the official names started with 1 for each tier, as in &amp;ldquo;The Second Coil of Bahamut, Turn 1,&amp;rdquo; but the western community simply continued to count upward from where the previous tier left off, and that trend caught on, which is how we got the convention for abbreviating all the 8-man raids since then.</description></item><item><title>Company Credits</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/company-credits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/company-credits/</guid><description>| noun | 1.

Tank and healer gear simply never has direct hit on it natively, so the only way to get it as a tank or healer is by melding direct hit materia.</description></item><item><title>Disciple of War</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/disciple-of-war/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/disciple-of-war/</guid><description>| noun | 1.

Total healing done divided by the length of the encounter, in seconds. Some players often mistake this for a much more important metric than it is. In reality, high HPS can most easily be achieved by spamming unnecessary heals, which is extremely inefficient and wasteful. Even if you heal efficiently, only doing the bare minimum amount of healing necessary to keep people alive, your HPS will be higherr if your group simply takes more damage, either by failing mechanics, failing to dodge AoEs, or not mitigating attacks properly.</description></item><item><title>Heaven On High</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/heaven-on-high/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/heaven-on-high/</guid><description>| noun | 1. &amp;ldquo;Deep Dungeon&amp;rdquo; content up to level 70.

In the first raid series, Coil, the encounters in each of the raid tiers were named &amp;ldquo;Turn 1, Turn 2, &amp;quot; and so on, so they are abbreviated as T1-T13.
