| noun | 1.  	A mechanic that places traps around the area, which have an initial visual indicator, before usually becoming invisible. If a player moves into the area originally indicated for the mine, it will detonate, dealing damage and sometimes applying paralysis to nearby players. Depending on the encounter, they must either be avoided... or intentionally detonated to prevent them from later exploding on their own, dealing heavy raid-wide damage and sometimes applying paralysis.	|
