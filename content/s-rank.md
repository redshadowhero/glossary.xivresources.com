| noun | 1.  	S-rank marks are extremely dangerous enemies that offer even greater rewards than A-rank marks. They are designed to be challenged by a large number of players at the same level as the mark. They have 48-72 hour respawn timers, as well as specific spawn conditions that must be met to trigger the mark to spawn. 

Each mark's spawn conditions are unique, and discovering each mark's spawn conditions when they are introduced with a new expansion is often an arduous process of trial and error.	|
