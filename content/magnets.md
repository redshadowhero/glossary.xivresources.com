| noun | 1.  	A mechanic that tethers pairs of players together, placing + and - symbols over their heads, indicating how they must position in order to pass the mechanic. If the paired players have the same symbol, they will be knocked directly away from each other when the mechanic resolves, usually resulting in being pushed into something bad if performed incorrectly. If they have opposite symbols, they will be pulled together, often being damaged, killed, or given nasty debuffs if this causes them to collide. Players must position themselves accordingly.	|
