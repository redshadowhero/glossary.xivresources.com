title: Fisher
---
| noun | 1.  	A very unique Disciple of the Land with staggering depth, no pun intended. A collector's or completionist's greatest dream... or their worst nightmare. For those that enjoy it, chasing after rare Big Fish or trying to fill out the entire fishing log is an endgame all on its own. While some things gathered by Fishers are used in crafting recipes, most are not. They simply exist for the variety and the challenge. When I say there are hardcore Fishers, it's not an exaggeration.	|
