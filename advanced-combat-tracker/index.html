<h1>Advanced Combat Tracker</h1>
<div class=content>
<p>| noun | 1. A third-party tool that parses combat data and presents it in a more meaningful, organized fashion, capable of displaying things like damage dealt, healing done, damage taken, frequency of critical and/or direct hits, etc. Colloquially referred to as a &ldquo;parser&rdquo; or &ldquo;DPS meter.&rdquo; More accurately, ACT is a program used for a variety of games and purposes, and the FFXIV Plugin for ACT is the parser. Using it is technically against the Terms of Service, but there is an unofficial understanding that it is an invaluable learning tool, and much of the information we have about how to play jobs efficiently would have been virtually impossible to figure out without the data that ACT is able to provide. For that reason, SE looks the other way as long as players do not talk about it in-game. If you admit to using ACT in any in-game chat, you risk action being taken against your account. All it would take is for one person to report you for it because they don&rsquo;t like you, even if you weren&rsquo;t being rude or using it to harass anyone. If you do use it to harass or belittle people in-game and someone reports you for it, the response will likely be swift and severe. Parse responsibly, and at your own risk. |</p>
