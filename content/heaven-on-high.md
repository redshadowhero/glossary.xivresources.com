title: Heaven On High
---
| noun | 1.  	"Deep Dungeon" content up to level 70. 

Accessible by level 61 jobs and above. Only has 100 floors, compared to Palace of the Dead's 200 floors. 

May also be referred to as "Steep Dungeon," because instead of delving deeper underground, you are climbing a tower to the heavens.	|
