| --- | --- |
| noun | 1.  	A linkshell is an established, invite-only chat channel, similar to how guild chat works in many games, but a linkshell is only the chat. Players can join up to eight regular linkshells. These are limited to players native to your own home server, and have a maximum capacity of 128 members each. Players may also join up to eight cross-world linkshells. These are only limited by your data center, which contains multiple servers, but each cross-world linkshell has a reduced maximum capacity of 64 members.	|
