---
| noun | 1.  	A variety of buffs that may be purchased with company credits by FC members with the relevant permission. Once activated, a buff will affect everyone in the FC until the buff expires, 24h after its activation. Only two such buffs may be active at a time, and attempting to activate a third would require one of the current buffs to be discarded, ending its effect immediately.	|
