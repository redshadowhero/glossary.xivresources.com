<p>Macros are often used to partially automate crafting by executing a series of crafting actions in a predetermined order, greatly reducing the number of required inputs. Only one macro can be running at a time.</p>
<p>Notably, macros cannot utilize the skill queueing system, which allows for the seamless execution of actions by largely eliminating latency- and input-related delays between actions. For this reason, using them for combat actions can be clunky at best, and cause increased delays between actions at worst.</p>
<p>There are some niche exceptions in which macros may be worthwhile for certain combat actions. |</p>
