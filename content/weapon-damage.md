| noun | 1.  	The single most potent stat on any of your equipment: the damage listed on your weapon. Has a larger effect on your damage dealt and healing done than anything else, including main stat upgrades. Thus, your weapon is almost always the most effective piece of equipment to upgrade. Usually referred to as "weapon damage," though technically, it's listed as "Magic Damage" on the weapons of casters and healers.	|
