| noun | 1.  	Refers to the way the game calculates the effect of an action at a singular moment, and the action is only affected by the modifiers that were active at the moment of calculation, regardless of how long the animation takes to complete or how long it takes for the effect to apply. The moment of calculation always occurs before the effect is applied, and the amount of time between calculation and application can vary significantly depending on the action. This interaction is most obvious for damage/healing over time effects, whose entire duration will be affected by all the modifiers that were active when the effect was applied, even if the modifiers expire immediately after application. This also means that you cannot modify an existing DoT/HoT, but must apply buffs, debuffs, or mitigation before the effect is applied in order to affect the calculation.	|
