| noun | 1.  	The Eorzean standard unit of measurement used for medium-sized distances. This is the unit used in tooltips to describe the range of player actions. Less importantly, "ilms" are the analogue of inches, and "malms" are the analogue of miles... at least, in the English localization. The other localizations simply use meters.	|
