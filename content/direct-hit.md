title: Direct Hit
---
| noun | 1.  	The DPS "role substat" that gives you a chance to score "direct hits," which multiply the damage of an attack by 1.25, like a mini-critical hit. Only damaging abilities can score direct hits. Though the tank and healer role substats have no effect on other roles, the DPS "role substat" does function on tanks and healers. Tank and healer gear simply never has direct hit on it natively, so the only way to get it as a tank or healer is by melding direct hit materia.	|
