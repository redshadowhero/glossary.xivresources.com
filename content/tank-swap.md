| noun | 1.  	Having one tank take the enemy from the current tank, typically by using Provoke and/or Shirk. Carefully timed tank swaps are sometimes "required" by mechanics (though the requirement can sometimes be circumvented with a tank invuln). It may also be done to rotate through both tanks' defensive cooldowns, allowing for more damage mitigation overall.	|
