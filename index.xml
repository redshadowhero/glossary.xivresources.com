Animation lock on instant actions tends to be around 0.6-0.7s (ping and latency variable). For casted skills the animation lock is about (0.1+2/fps) seconds (also known as caster tax).
For the duration of the lock your character is frozen and cannot cast another action.</description></item><item><title>AoE</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/aoe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/aoe/</guid><description>Area of Effect</description></item><item><title>FFXIV</title><link>https://glossary.xivresources.com/ffxiv/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://glossary.xivresources.com/ffxiv/</guid><description>Did you know that the critically acclaimed MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV has a free trial, and includes the entirety of A Realm Reborn AND the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions on playtime?
