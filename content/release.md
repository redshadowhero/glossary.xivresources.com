title: Release
---
| noun | 1.  	After death, a player may "release" instead of waiting to be raised. In the overworld, they will respawn at their home aetheryte (the aetheryte their Return is set to). 

In an instance, they will respawn at the beginning of the instance. In a multi-boss instance such as a dungeon or alliance raid, they will be locked out of the currently engaged boss room until the encounter resets due to a wipe or is successfully completed, but they will be able to rejoin the party at that point. 

It is worth noting that releasing does not inflict the player with Weakness, so if you die at the very end of a fight, it may be advantageous to deliberately release and take the shortcut to quickly rejoin the party in order to avoid the hefty two minute damage penalty from being raised.	|
