| noun | 1.  	What is perceived to be the "most optimal" thing. May refer to party composition, individual jobs, strategies for handling mechanics, etc. Claims about "meta" are often dubious, as it makes very little difference and is largely irrelevant outside of competitive speed runs and world progression.	|
