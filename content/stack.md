title: Stack
---
| noun | 1.  	1) A "stack marker" is the indicator for mechanics that divide damage evenly between all targets within the designated area. These require a sufficient number of players to position themselves inside the area to split, or "soak," the damage to avoid death. Stack markers come in circular and linear varieties. 2) Positioning very close to, or directly on top of, something or someone. For example, stacking [the party] behind the boss or stacking with another player. Also refers to the group itself when players are stacking, e.g. splitting into two stacks of four players.	|
