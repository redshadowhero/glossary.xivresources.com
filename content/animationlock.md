Animation lock refers to the amount of time your character is locked in animation from casting an action, skill, ability, etc., preventing you from doing any other action. 

Animation lock on instant actions tends to be around 0.6-0.7s (ping and latency variable). For casted skills the animation lock is about (0.1+2/fps) seconds (also known as caster tax). 

For the duration of the lock your character is frozen and cannot cast another action. Understanding animation lock is important to weaving instant oGCDs under instant GCDs effectively.
