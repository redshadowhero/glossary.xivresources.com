title: Durability
---
| noun | 1.  	The durability of a crafting recipe is a resource that is consumed by crafting actions that increase the quality or progress of the craft. It must be carefully managed using various crafting actions, because if the durability is reduced to zero (before the final step of the craft), the synthesis fails, and the materials are usually lost.
