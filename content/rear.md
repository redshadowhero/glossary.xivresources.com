| noun | 1.  	A 90-degree arc behind the target, opposite from where the target is facing. The arc is indicated by the gap in the targeting circle on most enemies. An enemy with no gap in its targeting circle is omni-directional, and all positional skill requirements are considered to be met regardless of positioning.	|
