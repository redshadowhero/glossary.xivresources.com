| --- | --- |
| noun | 1.  	Total healing done divided by the length of the encounter, in seconds. Some players often mistake this for a much more important metric than it is. In reality, high HPS can most easily be achieved by spamming unnecessary heals, which is extremely inefficient and wasteful. Even if you heal efficiently, only doing the bare minimum amount of healing necessary to keep people alive, your HPS will be higherr if your group simply takes more damage, either by failing mechanics, failing to dodge AoEs, or not mitigating attacks properly. Like most metrics for healers, on its own, HPS is an almost completely useless metric.	|
