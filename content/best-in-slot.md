| noun | 1.  	The most optimal configuration of equipment and materia for a given situation, typically for a given raid tier. "Optimal," in this case, means "results in the most damage, in practice." There are often multiple BiS sets for a single job, depending on the circumstances, such as different party comps, wanting different GCD speeds, or needing to meet different piety requirements as a healer.	|
