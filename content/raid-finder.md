| noun | 1.  	A system similar to the Duty Finder, used to register the current high-end duties that are not part of the Duty Finder: namely, the current Extreme trials, Savage raids, and Ultimate raids. Raid Finder is frequently used on Japanese data centers to form matchmade parties for such high end content, but it is almost never used that way anywhere else. When used to form matchmade parties, it employs stricter matchmaking rules to ensure a balanced party composition, because high-end duties are often unforgiving if you have an imbalanced party, such as not having any melee DPS or having two White Mages who cannot apply shields to the party.	|
