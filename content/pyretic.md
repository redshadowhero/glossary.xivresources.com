| noun | 1.  	A mechanic that places a debuff on players, dealing significant amounts of continuous damage as long as the player is performing any action during the debuff, including using skills, casting, moving, auto attacking, and rotating their character. To avoid taking damage, players must cease all movement and actions for the duration of the debuff, including sheathing their weapons or deselecting the enemy to prevent themselves from auto attacking.	|
