| noun | 1.  	A relic weapon, which is upgraded over the course of an entire expansion through a series of time consuming quests. Each expansion's relic weapons look very distinctive, and they often have elaborate glows and special visual effects. While they are mid-tier weapons for most of the expansion if kept up to date, they eventually become the Best in Slot weapons when the final upgrade step is released, several months after the release of the last raid tier of the expansion. Still, they are a widely popular pursuit for all kinds of players, as they offer some of the most unique appearances for glamour; the appearance changes from step to step, and replicas of previously completed steps can be cheaply acquired from vendors.	|
