title: Repair/Equipment Condition
---

| --- | --- |
| noun | 1.  	Your equipped gear loses Condition as you defeat enemies or are defeated yourself. If the Condition of a piece of equipment reaches zero, it "breaks" and will not give you any stats until it is repaired. Equipment can be repaired by "Mender" NPCs, which appear as a hammer icon on the map. 

You may also repair your own equipment if you meet the repair requirements and have the requisite material (the appropriate grade of Dark Matter, or higher, purchasable from various vendors). 
You will need the associated crafter leveled up to at least 10 levels under the item's equip level. For example, to repair heavy armor that requires level 80 to equip, you would need to have Armorer at level 70 or above to repair it. 

If you level all your crafters (except Culinarian, which doesn't craft or repair gear) to at least 10 levels below level cap, you can repair all your gear anywhere, including within instanced content where you don't have access to a Mender. When you repair your own gear, the Condition may be restored up to 199% of its normal maximum Condition.	|
