| noun | 1.  	The level 50 Coils of Bahamut raid series. 

The encounters in each of the raid tiers were named "Turn 1, Turn 2, " etc., so they are abbreviated as T1-T13. 

The first tier was The Binding Coil of Bahamut (BCoB). 
The second tier was The Second Coil of Bahamut (SCoB), and the final tier was The Final Coil of Bahamut (FCoB). 

Note: the official names started with 1 for each tier, as in "The Second Coil of Bahamut, Turn 1," but the western community simply continued to count upward from where the previous tier left off, and that trend caught on, which is how we got the convention for abbreviating all the 8-man raids since then.	|
