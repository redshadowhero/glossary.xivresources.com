title: Reset
---
| noun | 1.  	Having the whole party deliberately die to reset an encounter and begin another pull, usually because something has gone so wrong that it is impossible or not worthwhile to salvage the pull. |

| noun | 2.  	Dragging an enemy far enough away from its original location that it drops its threat table and returns to its starting point, becoming temporarily invulnerable and resetting to full HP as it does so. The distance required varies, but with a couple exceptions in early 2.x dungeons, enemies in dungeons and alliance raids do not have a distance limit and will never reset in this way. |

| noun | 3.  	Refers to the time at which daily/weekly lockout timers are refreshed, such as for weekly tomestone limits, daily quests, etc.	|
